# A Large-Scale Dataset for Short-Video Topic Peak Prediction and a Large Heterogeneous Graph Model

This repository contains the code and data associated with the paper **"A Large-Scale Dataset for Short-Video Topic Peak Prediction and a Large Heterogeneous Graph Model."**

## Overview

The project aims to predict the peak popularity of short-video topics by leveraging a large heterogeneous graph model. The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **`model/`**: Contains the code for all models used in the benchmark. These models are designed to handle large-scale datasets for short-video topic peak prediction, utilizing heterogeneous graph structures.
  
- **`data/`**: Includes code for data handling. This folder provides:
  - Original data in JSON format.
  - Processed data files, ready for use in experiments.
  - Node features will be available in future versions, as they are being finalized.
